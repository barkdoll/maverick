# Maverick
is a responsive Ghost theme for solo bloggers built on top of my blank theme [Pasty Ghost](https://github.com/barkdoll/pasty-ghost). 

It aims to be responsive while providing a two-column left sidebar layout for larger viewports. Posts use material design shadows.

All CSS is compiled from Sass (SCSS).
